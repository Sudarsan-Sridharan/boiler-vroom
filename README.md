# Boiler Vroom

> Fun is fun, powered by Vert.x.

This is the _Boiler Vroom_ demo that was first introduced in the [Devoxx France 2017 University session on reactive programming with Eclipse Vert.x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWsilpiSqw) by Julien Ponge and Julien Viet.

This demo is based on a Dj-ing experience with Traktor Pro 2 where the audience can interact through web applications on the mix:

* change patterns in a sequencer that controls a _remix deck_,
* apply filter effects,
* see what the Dj does on volumes and EQs,
* listen to the mix broadcast on their devices.
